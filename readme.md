# Laravel-CUBiM

CUBiM is an application for introducing and managing medical library user's personal data that is important to the library itself. Gaining control over this data improves the statistics 
needed by the institution to make strategical decisions such as which books to buy, etc.

## Tools

The original version of this product was built using [Symfony](http://symfony.com) but due to requirements made by final clients for later support, it's being migrated to [Laravel](http://laravel.com) 5.1 LTS.
